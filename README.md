# Computer-Vision

This repository contains different libraries and resources for computer vision projects developed by Virat Srivastava.

## Libraries

The repository is organized into the following libraries:

1. PIL: PIL (Python Imaging Library) is a popular open-source library in Python for image processing and manipulation tasks. It provides a wide range of functionalities for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. With PIL, you can perform operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, filtering, and enhancing images. It also supports basic image editing features like adding text, drawing shapes, and applying various effects. PIL is widely used in computer vision, web development, scientific research, and other areas where image processing is required.

2. OpenCV: OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision and image processing. It offers a rich set of functions and algorithms to handle tasks like image manipulation, object detection, and video analysis. With support for multiple programming languages, OpenCV is widely used in various domains such as robotics, augmented reality, and medical imaging. It serves as a valuable tool for developers working on computer vision applications.
